    "prompt": "You are reviewing only the attached files in a new jersey serff filing. Ignore the serff-generated filing summary and general information tabs. This check applies mainly to billing plans, payment plan descriptions, declarations pages, or other documents that describe how premiums are billed and what non-premium charges may apply.\n\nRequirement:\n\n1. If a document describes any fee that is separate from the base premium (for example installment fees, billing plan fees, service fees, late fees, returned-check/nsf fees, electronic payment fees, or similar charges), the document must:\n- Give the fee a plain-language name;\n- State either a fixed dollar amount or a specific formula that allows the fee to be calculated;\n- Explain exactly what event triggers the fee (for example use of an installment plan, a missed payment, or a returned check); and\n- State whether the fee is charged per installment, per occurrence, or per policy term.\n\n2. The document may not hide fees behind vague phrases such as \"other fees may apply\", \"service charge\", or \"miscellaneous fee\" without also providing the concrete amount or formula and trigger for each such fee.\n\n3. If the document appears to describe bail bond business (for example, it repeatedly refers to bail bonds, defendants, or bond forfeiture), it must not impose separate \"banking fees\" for returned checks or stop payments, nor other service-related fees such as after-hours or travel fees, because n.j.a.c. 11:17b-3.2(d) prohibits bail bond agencies from charging those specific fees.\n\nThe filing passes this check only if every billing- or payment-related document that mentions non-premium charges meets the disclosure requirements in (1) and (2), and no bail bond document imposes the prohibited fees in (3). If you find any fee that is unclear, incompletely described, or clearly prohibited, treat this check as failed and identify the problematic language."

    "prompt": "You are reviewing only the attached files in a new jersey serff filing. Ignore the serff-generated filing summary and general information tabs. This check focuses on compliance with new jersey's plain language act (n.j.s.a. 56:12-1 et seq.) and the insurance readability rules (n.j.a.c. 11:2-18) for consumer insurance forms.\n\nTreat as \"consumer-facing\" any policy, endorsement, application, billing plan, or notice that is intended to be read and signed or relied on by an individual insured or small business policyholder, rather than only by regulators or internal staff.\n\nRequirements:\n\n1. Affidavit / certificate of compliance:\n- There should be at least one attached affidavit or certificate of compliance stating that the contract and related writings comply with the plain language law (n.j.s.a. 56:12-1 et seq.) and n.j.a.c. 11:2-18, and stating the flesch reading ease test score (or equivalent) for the form(s).\n- That affidavit should also say that the forms are printed in at least the minimum type size required by the readability rules (typically at least 10-point type for policies and at least 8-point type for certain applications), or equivalent wording.\n- For each consumer-facing form in the filing, its form number should appear somewhere in that affidavit or in an attached list that the affidavit explicitly covers.\n\n2. Plain language of the forms themselves:\n- Consumer-facing forms should use straightforward, everyday language, with reasonably short sentences and paragraphs, and should avoid long blocks of all-capital text, dense cross-references, and unnecessary legal jargon.\n- Key obligations, fees, and time periods should be stated directly and unambiguously, not hidden in complex subordinate clauses or double negatives.\n- Headings, section titles, and numbering should help the reader navigate the document, and important concepts such as fees, cancellations, and coverage limitations should be easy to locate.\n\nThe filing passes this check only if (a) there is a clear plain-language/readability affidavit that covers the consumer-facing forms in the filing, and (b) on a reasonable reading, those forms themselves appear simple, clear, understandable, and easily readable in line with the plain language act and n.j.a.c. 11:2-18. If either the affidavit coverage or the readability of the forms is clearly deficient, treat this check as failed and describe what is missing."

The file fails this check if it includes statements such as 'this policy is governed by the laws of [other state]', 'filed with the [other state] department of insurance', or similar language that obviously points to a different state as the controlling jurisdiction. References to federal law, generic phrases like 'applicable state law', or historical examples are acceptable.
